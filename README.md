Version control systems prove to be very useful in helping to keep code, and documents in general, manageable for software developers. 
One advantage of a version control system is the ability to create branches and then merge them to your main document/repository. Branches allow for developers to create a duplicate version of the repository that they can then work on without affecting the original repository. This gives the advantage of multiple developers being able to work on the same piece of work at the same time, they can then merge their changes back to the main repository. When merging, the version control system will make you aware of any conflicts that need to be dealt with before the merge can happen. This makes working on large projects within sizable teams easier and allows for greater control over documents.
